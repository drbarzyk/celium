                Join the Celium Network, and take control of how you learn to innovate.
                Learning is hard – we’ve all tried to become self-taught in something without success.
                When it comes to computer science education, it can be an even greater shot in the dark.
                With so many emerging applications, language updates, and other exciting tech releases, it can be hard to keep up by yourself.
                The Celium Network exists to help guide aspiring developers through the journey of computer science education.
                By joining Celium, you will open yourself to new relationships within a network of passionate, creative, and inspired developers eager to collaborate.
                Join the Hyphae Army, make lasting connections, and build the future!
