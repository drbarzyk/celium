                Relevant - does it meet some need, is it valuable / important to society?<br />
                Responsive - does it do what you want quickly and positively, on all devices?<br />
                Robust - does it easily handle unexpected events?<br />
                <br />
                We take pride in staying ahead of the curve - that’s why we only use the most up-to-date tools on the web to develop our solutions; including React.js, Solidity, MongoDB, and SwiftUI.
